# purpose

scripts for making an rsync server that can be transparently rsync'd to as if
it was just a plain directory, but which actually creates a hardlink-based
snapshot each time it is written to. includes cleanup of obsolete backups if
configured, with some flexibility as to what "obsolete" means.

this whole thing is a giant hack because it rewrites the `rsync --server`
command that rsync send to the remote machine. it isn't a bad as it sounds
though: `--server` mode isn't fully documented but cannot change that much
without breaking backwards compatibility. also, rsync actually has an option
`--remote-option` precisely to run the `rsync --server` process with different
options than the local rsync, so it is supported to some extent.

the repo also contains scripts for a [pull-type backup](pullbackup/README.md),
and [auxiliary scripts for backup to and from nextcloud](nextcloud/README.md).

## advantages of push-type backup

- client can backup from wherever it is and whenever it wants (and is up)
- client is in control of excludes and therefore can prevent leaking secrets
- client cannot maliciously flush out old backups by creating hundreds of
  new backups
- no client-side setup required beyond creating a cronjob that calls rsync
  (though with a rather long command line if excludes are involved)
- backups can be easily listed and restored from client-side
- "I want a backup now" is easily done from client-side

## disadvantages / limitations

- server needs a fixed hostname, and has to actually be reachable by all
  backup clients (beware asymmetrical firewalls)
- clients are hard to schedule on the server: if they all connect at the same
  time, the server may run out of memory, and IO will definitely not be
  particularly fast
- monitoring missed backups on the server is somewhat harder than for the
  pull backup
- backups cannot be triggered by the server at all

# client-side usage

client-side usage is generally simply 'like rsync', though there are minor
differences:

- different connecting hosts see different storage spaces. this is analogous to
  connecting with different users, but here is actually determined by the ssh
  key the client uses for login.
- the 'directory' after the backup hostname isn't actually a directory, but a
  backup space as configured on the server (see below). for restores, you can
  target a particular backup by its timestamp.
- the server will reject or force some options. some of these are required for
  proper operation, others keep you from creating a corrput backup.
- you cannot back up only part of the source directory. the script internally
  uses `rsync --link-dest` which doesn't support partial updates.
- restore and list don't support multiple source arguments. when rung from SSH
  with a forced command, these cannot be distingushed from arguments containg
  spaces.

## backup

backup can be as simple as
`rsync -avxHAX --delete-delay --numeric-ids / backups@supernova:root`
though you probably want to add some excludes. make sure the source path
always ends with a slash so that rsync sends the directory contentes rather
than the directory itself. that is, the correct command for `/var` is
`rsync -avxHAX --delete-delay --numeric-ids /var/ backups@supernova:var`.
removing `-v` (verbose) and adding `-q` (quiet mode) can be useful to reduce
the amount of logging, especially for cronjobs.

excludes are specified as described INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES in the rsync
manpage. essentially, it's usually either `-e /var/tmp/` (leading & trailing
slash) to exclude a directory and all its contents, or `-e /var/tmp/**` to
backup the directory itself but exclude its contents. the latter is correct
for /tmp, /var/tmp and similar directories where the directory needs to exist
and with a particular set of permissions, but its contents are temporary cruft.

## verify

backup verification is done by doing a dry-run transfer in checksum mode,
that is, by adding `-nic` to the backup command:
`rsync -avxHAXnic --delete-delay --numeric-ids / backups@supernova:root`.
checksum mode (`-c`) isn't strictly necessary but the verification doesn't
verify much without it. either `-v` or `-i` is required to get output.
normally you'd want to use the same excludes as for the backup, but omitting
them explicitly can be useful to get a list of excluded files as well.

unlike backup, verify mode can target a particular backup to compare against,
see restore mode below.

## restore

restoring essentially involves swapping source and destination operands as in
`rsync -avxHAX --delete-delay --numeric-ids backups@supernova:root /` though
you'd never want to restore to '/'. this can restore individual directories or
single files the way you'd usually do with rsync:
`rsync -avxH --numeric-ids backups@supernova:root/etc/default/ /etc/default`.
don't forget the trailing slash, though, or the restored data will end up in
`/etc/default/default`.

restore mode is much more flexible with respect to the options it accepts.
essentially, it accepts anything that only affects the client or that may not
be supported by the client. in particular `-AX` (ACLs and extended attributes)
are optional. so is `-H` (hardlinks), though you almost always want to preserve
those for a system backup. obviously you can restore to a different path than
the one you originally backed it up from: rsync just doesn't care. symlinks may
break in the same way they do when you move them, but for system backup that's
usually better than messing them up.

a particular backup can be targeted for restore by attaching its timestamp to
the name of the backup space: `backups@supernova:root@2020-01-01_00-00-00`
targets the `root` space as it was on that date. this timestamp can be
shortened as long as it stays unique – if there was no other backup on that
day, `backups@supernova:root@2020-01-01` also selects that backup. this can be
combined with paths as in `backups@supernova:root@2020-01-01/etc/default/`.

## list mode

backup data can be listed using `rsync --list-only`, either with or without
recursive mode (`-r`): `rsync --list-only backups@supernova:root` lists the
files in the root, `rsync -r --list-only backups@supernova:root` lists the
entire tree, and `rsync -r --list-only backups@supernova:root/etc/` lists a
subdirectory tree.

timestamp specifications are similar to restore mode, but behave differently:
- if no path is given (`backups@supernova:root@2020-01`), it lists all
  backups matching that specification (and their contents if `-r` is given).
  in particular, a timestamp of `@` matches all backups (it's a simple prefix
  match), so that `rsync --list-only backups@supernova:root@` can be used to
  list all backups for a backup space.
- if a path is given, it behaves identically to restore, and lists the contents
  of the backup space at that point in time, which must be unique. note that
  you can give the path as `/.` to force this behavior:
  `rsync --list-only backups@supernova:root@2020-01-01/.` lists that particular
  backup if it's unique.

# setup

## installation on server

- create a user for the backup server: `adduser backups --disabled-password`
  (optional)
- place `pushbackup.py`, `rsyncparser.py` and `confparser.py` somewhere
  convenient (`/usr/local/lib/pushbackup/` would be LSB-y, or just put them
  into `~backups`). make sure `pushbackup.py` is `chmod +x`
- configure `pushbackup.conf` with appropriate defaults (see below). it goes
  in `~backups` unless you configure the path differently (using
  `-c /etc/pushbackup.conf` in the forced SSH command)
- make sure rsync is installed ;)

## setting up a client

- create an SSH key on the client: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /root/backup.key`
- on the server, configure `~backups/.ssh/authorized_keys` with that key and a
  forced command:
```
no-pty,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,command="/usr/local/lib/pushbackup/pushbackup.py supernova" ssh-ed25519 AAAA…M remote-backup@supernova
```
- configure the client's backup spaces in `pushbackup.conf`. if the defaults
  are fine, simply create them instead. however, backup spaces have to either
  exist or be configured to be usable!
- determine which directories to include in / exclude from the backup and
  write a corresponding rsync command (see above). excludes can be given as
  `-e /tmp/**`, or use `-f ._/root/rsync-root.filters` with `rsync.filters`
  as contained in the repo. see the FILTER RULES section in rsync's manpage
  for details
- execute the rsync command to check that it works and to create the initial
  backup (can take a while if it's large)
- create a cronjob to execute that command on whatever schedule you desire.
  do make sure backup-cooldown is set to allow that frequency, though

# configuration

configuration is the usual not-quite-ini format used by most programs. it has
a `[global]` section for defaults, `[hostname]` for individual hosts, and
`[hostname:space]` for for individual backup spaces. comments start with `#`
and must be on a line of their own (no comments after values or section names).
for any given host and backup space, it uses the most specific value of:

- the per backup space section `[hostname:space]`
- the per host section `[hostname]`
- the global defaults from `[global]`
- the built-in defaults

in most cases, options can simply be set globally and there is no need to
configure them individually for each host + backup space combination. (this is
why it also treats an existing directory like a configured backup space.)

## backup storage location

`target` sets the backup location. `{HOST}` and `{SPACE}` are replaced with the
client's hostname and backup space, respectiely. usually, this is something
like `target=/srv/backups/{HOST}-{SPACE}` or `/srv/backups/{HOST}/{SPACE}`.
this is a required option; there is no built-in default.

## root attribute storage method

pushbackup needs to store permissions, owners and groups, which are privileged
operations. the `root` option sets how these are handled:

- `root=me` is used when pushbackup is simply run as root. this is the easiest
  configuration but requires either installing it into root's `authorized_keys`
  and logging in as root (which requires `PermitRootLogin=prohibit-password`
  and is usually considered a bad idea), or having a sudo command in
  `authorized_keys` (still feels somewhat unsafe).
- `root=sudo` simply uses `sudo` for all root operations. note that sudo needs
  to have permissions to run rsync, and there is no reasonable way to restrict
  rsync from doing arbitrary file overwrite – this is what pushbackup.py is
  for. thus sudo might as well be configured as `NOPASSWD: ALL`.
- `root=fake` uses rsync's `--fake-super` and stores those attributes in an
  extended attribute named `user.rsync.%stat`. this Just Works™ without root
  rights and is therefore the default. it does however have the disadvantage
  that the backup needs to be restored with rsync (it cannot be simply copied
  into place) which is why this is configurable.

## backup retention

by default, backups are kept forever, which in practice means until the disk
runs full and the admin needs to delete old backups. because that is tediuos
and error-prone, pushbackup can automate it.

- if only `keep-duration` is set, all backups older than the configured limit
  are deleted. usually set to something like `keep-duration=30d` because
  backups that old aren't much better than no data any more.
- if only `keep-count` is set, that many backups are kept. this is not the
  same as `keep-duration` if there are admin-initiated backups, or if the host
  isn't up 24/7 and thus skips some backups. cannot be set to a value less
  than 1 because at that point, it would be erasing the only remaining backup.
- if both are set, pushbackup deletes any backups that are older than
  `keep-duration` until only `keep-count` backups are left. this allows rules
  like '10 backups but at least 7 days worth of backups' (accomodating some
  admin-initiated ones in between the daily ones), or '30 days but at least 15
  backups' (accomodating a host that isn't always up for its daily backup).
- by default, backups are never deleted automatically

## backup cooldown (ratelimit)

`backup-cooldown` gives the minimum time between two backups. this prevents
hosts from using excess resources sending backups rapid-fire. it also somewhat
mitigates filling up the disk maliciuosly, though clients can always also send
a single 427GB, all-zeros file for that. the default is zero, ie. backups can
be fired off as fast as rsync allows.
